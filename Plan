Plan
1) Writing structure to files as binary data means that
we can no longer use dynamically-allocated artist
and title names.
If we use fwrite and fread we can't use dyanmicly storage (use arrays!)

2) Every time the menu is displayed, the program should also show
 a.the name of the current file (if there is one) and 
 b.how many records are being currently stored in memory.

3) Ensure that the "Save" and "Save as" options promt for confirmation
if the file already exists. The "Append" option can create a new file if necessary.

4) Allow the program to take an optional command-line parameter - 
the name of a file that contains CD details.

5) We never want to lose data, so ensure that if the user attempts to read a list from a file or create a new list (or exit the program) while unsaved CDs are in the current list, then the program will ask the user if they are sure they want to proceed.

6) Ensure that all functions that do not return a value are made VOID.
7) Use the ATEXIT functionality to provide some sort of goodbye message.
